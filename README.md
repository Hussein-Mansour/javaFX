# Shannon's theorem App

Shannon's theorem, formulated by Claude Shannon in information theory, establishes the maximum data rate (channel capacity) for reliable communication over a noisy channel.

Shannonâ€™s theorem is given by the following mathematical formula:

Where:
 - B is the bandwidth of the channel in hertz
 - S is the average received signal power over the bandwidth in watts
 - N is the average noise/interference power over the bandwidth in watts
 - C is the channel's upper limit in bits per second
